# Industrial Pipeline Fault Detection System

This project implements a multi-stage machine learning system for detecting, classifying, and estimating the intensity of faults in a simulated industrial pipeline. The system operates on time-series sensor data from vibration, pressure, and temperature sensors.

## Features

- **Anomalous Behavior Detection:** Utilizes an unsupervised learning approach to identify deviations from normal operating conditions.  
- **Fault Classification:** Classifies detected anomalies into specific fault types, such as leaks, blockages, or sensor failures.  
- **Fault Intensity Estimation:** Quantifies the severity of a fault using a regression model, providing a measure of its intensity.  
- **Comprehensive Fault Coverage:** Trained on a diverse synthetic dataset that includes single, combined, and sensor-specific faults.  

## Dataset Used

The system is trained and evaluated on a synthetically generated dataset to simulate a wide range of pipeline conditions, including:

- **Normal Data:** Stable and fluctuating operational data to establish a baseline.  
- **Process Faults:** Simulated events like leaks (pressure drop, vibration rise) and blockages (pressure spike), created with varying intensity (low, high) and speed (slow, fast).  
- **Sensor Faults:** Simulated sensor malfunctions, including flat-line and high-noise faults.  
- **Combined Faults:** Complex scenarios where multiple process and sensor faults occur simultaneously.  

## Model Architecture

The project uses a two-stage machine learning pipeline:

### Stage 1: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
- An **LSTM Autoencoder** is trained exclusively on normal pipeline data.  
- The model learns to reconstruct normal time-series patterns.  
- During inference, a high reconstruction error on a new data point indicates an anomaly.  
- **Purpose:** Identify when a fault occurs.

### Stage 2: Supervised Fault Classification & Intensity Estimation
- A **CNN-LSTM Multi-Task Learning model** is trained on extracted segments of anomalous data from Stage 1.  
- **1D CNN:** Extracts local, spatial features from the time-series segments.  
- **Bi-directional LSTM:** Processes these features to learn temporal dependencies.  
- **Output Heads:**  
  - **Classification Head:** Predicts the specific fault type.  
  - **Regression Head:** Estimates the fault intensity.  

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Core programming language  
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework  
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations and data manipulation  
- **Pandas**: Dataset handling and processing  
- **scikit-learn**: Data splitting, normalization, and evaluation metrics  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization and plotting
